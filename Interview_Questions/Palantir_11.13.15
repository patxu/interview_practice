3 rounds back-to-back

1.
design the game "astroids"
OOP
define logic for main while loop
object inheritance

2.
connect 4 string decoding

_ space
r red
b black

input: 9_4rbrb ...
output: 6x7 matrix of characters

edge cases: don't accept 1r, 0r, 3r4r, board overfilled/underfilled

3.
jquery parsing

input: query $(".a .b>.c")
  " " -> descendent
  ">" -> direct child
output: list of nodes

b
 \
  a
   \
    b
   / \
 a    c
 |     \
 c      d
 |
 d

class node:
  className
  children

runtime analysis: hard, j^n?
main and recursive helper
